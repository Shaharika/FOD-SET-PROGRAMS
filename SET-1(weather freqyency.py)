# Sample weather data

# Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each weather condition

# Calculate the frequency distribution
for condition in weather_data:
    if condition in weather_freq:
        weather_freq[condition] += 1
    else:
        weather_freq[condition] = 1

# Find the most common weather type
most_common_weather = max(weather_freq, key=weather_freq.get)

for condition, frequency in weather_freq.items():

Output:
Weather Frequency Distribution:
Sunny: 7 times
Rainy: 4 times
Cloudy: 4 times
The most common weather type is Sunny with 7 occurrences.
